Create a single-page Admin Panel component in ReactJS (in a `.js` file) with a separate `.css` file. Do not use Tailwind or any CSS framework.

The Admin Panel should contain:

1. **Top Navigation Bar**:
   - Logo or “Admin Dashboard” title
   - Admin name on the right (e.g., "Hi, Admin")
   - Logout button

2. **Sidebar Navigation** (collapsible if possible):
   - Dashboard
   - Manage Hotel Owners
   - Manage Users
   - Bookings
   - Payments
   - Subscription Plans
   - CMS (Content Management)
   - Settings

3. **Main Content Area** (show Dashboard by default):
   - 4 Stat Cards:
     - Total Users
     - Total Hotel Owners
     - Total Bookings
     - Total Revenue
   - Recent Bookings Table:
     - Columns: Booking ID, Hotel Name, Customer Name, Check-in, Check-out, Status
   - Line Chart (Monthly Bookings Overview)
     - Use Chart.js or placeholder div
   - Recent Alerts Section (example: “Room booked by Raju in Taj Hotel”)

4. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Use `useState()` to store sample booking/user data
   - Use `useEffect()` to simulate API calls (with setTimeout)
   - Sidebar menu click should change the content (use basic `useState` tab switching)

5. **Design Instructions**:
   - Use professional fonts and spacing
   - Orange-yellowish primary theme
   - Shadowed cards, hover effects
   - Sticky navbar and sidebar
   - Responsive layout using flex/grid
   - Separate `.css` file with proper class names and reusable styles

This should result in a realistic admin interface like a SaaS dashboard with good UI and dummy interactivity.











Create a single-page Hotel Owner Panel component using ReactJS in a `.js` file and styling in a separate `.css` file.

The component should act as a dashboard for hotel owners and include:

1. **Top Navigation Bar**:
   - Logo or “Hotel Owner Panel”
   - Owner Name with dropdown menu (Profile, Logout)
   - Notification icon (with dummy count)

2. **Sidebar Navigation**:
   - My Hotels
   - Add Hotel
   - Booking Requests
   - Earnings Report
   - Feedbacks
   - Subscription

3. **Main Content Area**:
   - Stat Cards (horizontal or grid):
     - Total Hotels Listed
     - Total Bookings
     - This Month's Revenue
     - Active Plan (Basic / Premium)
   - Hotel Table:
     - Hotel Name, Location, Price per night, Rooms available, Status (active/inactive)
   - Booking Notifications:
     - Show recent 3 bookings with hotel name, user name, booking date
   - Subscription Plan Card:
     - Plan Name, Expiry Date, Upgrade Button

4. **Functionality**:
   - Use `useState()` for mock data of hotels and bookings
   - `useEffect()` to simulate loading
   - Add dummy interaction like “Click Add Hotel” → alert or change view

5. **Design Style**:
   - Professional, modern look with orange/yellow primary color
   - Sidebar + navbar layout
   - Box shadows, rounded corners, hover transitions
   - Icons for each sidebar item (can be placeholders)
   - Fully responsive layout

Also, use clean CSS in a separate file. No frameworks allowed. Ensure all class names match between `.js` and `.css`.
